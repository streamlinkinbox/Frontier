// 💡 Extrude manifold outline (Blender's push-in): a planar face's loops as a sketch profile in a frame on its plane whose

//    outer CCW / holes CW. IslandCondition: every neighbour across its edges is a coplanar plane facing the same way —
//    an imprinted region, which no push can move (its neighbours would have to move with it).

// 💡 Sliver bridges (the Windows report "extrude manifold suppose to remove or move the top part"): a cut outline on a
//    planar face whose straight side runs parallel to a straight, convex rim edge of that face (its neighbour square or
//    sharper, so the region beyond the rim is air), closer than 1 % of the outline's span, would leave a strip of the face
//    thinner than that over the cut — a pocket drawn "to the edge" a pixel short. The side moves out past the rim by the
//    cutter lead (1e-3·scale) and its neighbouring sides follow along their own lines, so the walls stay exact and the cut
//    opens through the rim. Plane: the outline's frame; CutSign: the sign of the cut along Plane 𝑧 (the rim faces face
//    against it); Region: the imprinted face being pushed (its own edges are not rims), or none. Returns the sides moved;
//    the profile is unchanged when none qualifies or the moved outline would cross itself.

//    re-drawn between its new ends; each face touching a moved vertex is re-fitted — ① a plane when its new corners stay
//    coplanar (within 1e-8 · scale; a box edge slid across its faces, a corner slid along a face), ② a bilinear patch
//    (degree 1 × 1 NURBS through its four corners, its sides exactly the four straight edges) when a four-sided face can no
//    longer be flat, ③ otherwise refused — a curved face or edge at a moved vertex (a fillet, a hole's circle), a face of
//    more than four sides bent off its plane, a face turned inside out or folded, an edge collapsing to a point. Faces
//    away from the moved vertices keep their carriers and SP-curves; the result is assembled, audited and clash-checked
//    like every rebuild verb, so a reshape that would make the solid cross itself is refused.
