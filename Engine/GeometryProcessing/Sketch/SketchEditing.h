// 💡 Plasticity O on a solved sketch: every non-construction chain (curves chained end to end within 10⁻⁹·L) is offset
//    by Distance — closed chains grow for Distance > 0 and shrink for Distance < 0; open chains move to the left of their
//    first curve's drawn direction for Distance > 0. Lines shift along their normal, arcs and circles keep their centre
//    with radius r ± d; neighbouring offset pieces are re-joined at the intersection of their carriers nearest the
//    original corner (sharp, mitred corners — Plasticity's default), tangent joins stay tangent. Exact: every offset
//    point lies at |Distance| from its source curve. Refused (named) for splines (no exact offset 🚧), branching chains,
//    a circle or arc whose radius would vanish, and a piece the offset turns inside out (🚧 no loop clean-up).
[[nodiscard]] SketchOffsetOutcome OffsetSketchCurves(const SketchModel& Sketch, double Distance);

// 💡 Plasticity J: the curves of Joined (placed into Base coordinates by Placement) are appended to Base. A joined point
//    within Join of a base point (or an earlier joined point) is welded into it, so chains crossing the two sketches
//    profile as one; joined curve identifiers continue after Base's largest; a mirroring placement swaps arc ends (arcs
//    run counter-clockwise). Constraints come along with their references renumbered; when the placement moves the
//    frame, the frame-bound ones (Fixed, Horizontal, Vertical, Horizontal / Vertical distance, and Angle under a mirror)
//    are left out and counted in Dropped. Refused when the placement axes are not orthonormal.

//    of the other (IntersectProfileSegments within Join, ends included).
