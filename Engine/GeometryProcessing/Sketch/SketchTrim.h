// 💡 Every crossing of Target with Cutter: polyline seeds (knot spans / ≤ 45° arc pieces, 24 samples each) refined by
//    Newton on Target(s) − Cutter(t) = 0 over the exact curves, kept within Join; touching ends count. Sorted by
//    TargetFraction, duplicates (≤ 10⁻⁹) merged. Overlapping collinear pieces have no isolated crossing and are skipped.

// 💡 Plasticity T on curve CurveIndex of a solved sketch: the crossings come from the sketch's other curves (all, also
//    construction) and from Foreign (curves of coplanar sketches, already in this sketch's plane coordinates). The piece
//    holding Pick between neighbouring crossings comes off:
//      line / arc → shortened, or split in two (the second part is a new curve with the next identifier);
//      circle     → the complementary arc (needs ≥ 2 crossings);
//      no crossing on an open curve, or < 2 on a circle → the curve is erased (Plasticity behaviour);
//      spline with crossings → refused (the point-defined forms have no exact split).
//    Constraints: those on an erased curve drop and later curve references shift; a shortened line drops Length,
//    EqualLength, Midpoint and Symmetric; a split line copies Horizontal, Vertical, Parallel, Perpendicular and Angle to
//    its new part, a split arc copies Radius and EqualRadius. A new end made by a line, circle or arc of the same sketch
//    is pinned to it (PointOnLine / PointOnCircle) so later solves keep the trim.
[[nodiscard]] SketchTrimOutcome TrimSketchCurve(const SketchModel& Sketch, int CurveIndex, Vector2 Pick, const std::vector<ProfileSegment>& Foreign = {});

// 💡 Plasticity Cut on curve CurveIndex at the point nearest to Pick: nothing comes off, the curve breaks there.
//      line / arc → two curves meeting at one shared new point (the second part gets the next identifier);
//      circle     → two arcs, from the pick to Partner and back (same centre and radius); without Partner (or with one
//                   at the pick) two half arcs, the second break at the opposite point;
//      spline, or a pick on an open curve's end → refused.
//    A split line drops Length, EqualLength, Midpoint and Symmetric and copies Horizontal, Vertical, Parallel,
//    Perpendicular and Angle to its second part; a split arc / circle copies Radius and EqualRadius.

// 💡 Insert point: a new defining point on curve CurveIndex nearest to Pick, the shape unchanged (to be dragged next).
//      line / arc / circle → split there as Cut does (a circle also at the opposite point); a split line drops its
//                            direction constraints (H, V, parallel, perpendicular, angle) so the new point moves freely;
//      cubic spline        → a through-point at its parameter τ*: the curve keeps one τ per point (SketchCurve::Knots), and
//                            the natural C² interpolant on the refined parameters is the same cubic pieces (exact);
//      Hermite / Bezier / NURBS → the curve becomes a NURBS on its own knot vector with τ* inserted once (Boehm): one more
//                            control point, the neighbours moved so the curve stays the same (exact; Hermite through-points
//                            stay as control points on the curve, their handles become control points too).
//    Refused: the pick on an open end, on an existing point, or where a NURBS already has a corner knot.
