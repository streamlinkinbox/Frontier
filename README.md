## SolidArc

The standalone C++20 NURBS/B-rep modelling tool lives at
`Editor/AuthoringTools/Modelling/SolidArc`. The current bounded proof set reaches Phase 37f:
rolling-ball variable-radius corners, linear and nonlinear support-setback laws, a quadratic nonlinear-radius route,
a separate non-rolling G2 planar profile, and independent clearances on the two planar supports. Unsupported
rolling-ball G2, partial-edge, apex-fillets, freeform, and general intersection/trim cases refuse transactionally.
The latest proof is `Proofs/Phase37f_UnequalSetbackCorner.png`; run `Tools/Build/CheckSolidArc.sh` for the focused
dependency-free verification gate.
